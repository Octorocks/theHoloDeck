    text: "Edd is a smart and forward-thinking marketing and CRM expert with advanced technical expertise. He's self-starting, intellectually-curious and has transferable skills that will serve him well in various technical roles. We were able to give him a problem and trust him to find and implement solutions independently, and drive initiatives forward. \n \n He's also a pleasure to work with, as his popularity amongst colleagues demonstrates. Edd contributed a great deal to Hire Space and I'd have no hesitancy in recommending him in the fullest terms to future employers.",

    text: "No one knows Hubspot better than Edd. A legend of the custom code action and someone you could just say 'I want this to happen but I don't think it's possible' to and you'd get a notification a few days later saying he'd taught himself something new to achieve it, had got it doing exactly what you wanted, and noticed that something else was wrong that we hadn't noticed and had fixed that as well.",

    text: "Edd is one of those rare colleagues who just makes everything better—processes, systems, and the people around him. From the moment he joined, he’s been a huge asset, not just because he’s brilliant at what he does (which he is) but because he genuinely cares about making things easier for everyone. His work behind the scenes with our CRM has saved us all countless hours and headaches. \n \n But beyond the automations and HubSpot wizardry, Edd is just a fantastic person to work with. He’s always up for a chat, happy to share his knowledge (or a completely unexpected fun fact), and brings a sense of calm and humour to the team. He’s also one of the most supportive people I know, always looking out for others and making sure everyone feels valued.",

    text: "Edd is an absolute star of a colleague!! He is great at what he does, always happy to help, and just a genuinely lovely person to have around! As a CRM specialist, he keeps everything running smoothly behind the scenes, making sure our systems work seamlessly and our processes are as efficient as possible. I might not fully understand the magic he works with data, coding and automation, but I do know that things would be a lot more complicated without him! (He’s basically the wizard of HubSpot). \n \n Beyond his skills, Edd is one of those people you just enjoy being around. He’s full of interesting (and sometimes unexpected!) facts, and every day you learn something new about him! I’ll leave that for you to find out when you meet him! – Whether that be his latest project (like building a server), one of his numerous previous jobs (such as being a member of team GB for ice hockey!) or a random fun fact, he keeps things interesting and fun for all!",
